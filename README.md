## BulletinBoard

Digital version of a campus bulletin board created for Johns Hopkins University's undergraduate campus. Its 
layout was created June - August 2023, but the first draft of its JavaScript is removed while I'm learning how to 
implement it more efficiently and using the PERN stack in a Full-Stack Javascript class.
